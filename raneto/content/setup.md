### Get Familiar with the Workshop Environment

During the workshop, all of the instructions will be here in this panel on the left side of your screen. The right side of the screen contains one or more browser-based terminal windows.

As you complete the workshop, you will encounter commands that you need to execute, like the one below. When you see the red play button icon in a code block, you can click that code block and the command will execute in the terminal. 

Try it now!

#### Click the code block to execute:

```execute-1
echo "Hello from the terminal!"
```
You will also see some code blocks with the scissors icon. When you click those code blocks, the text inside will be copied to your clipboard so that you can paste it in the terminal.

#### Click the text to copy and then paste it in the terminal:

```copy
echo "Copying text to the clipboard"
```
