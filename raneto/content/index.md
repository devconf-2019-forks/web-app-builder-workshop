In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy modern single page web apps, such as ones created with React or Vue, to Red Hat OpenShift using a source-to-image (S2I) builder image for web apps.

First, you'll learn how to quickly deploy single page web apps for development purposes. Then, we'll cover how to combine the S2I image with a current HTTP server image, like NGINX, using an OpenShift chained build.

During the workshop, we will deploy both a React app and a Vue app, but you could follow a similar process for other frameworks as well.
